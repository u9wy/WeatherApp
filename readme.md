# WeatherApp

To build run on an android emulator or device. You must make sure the lombok plug in installed and annotation processing is enabled.

The project is hosted on GitHub accessible via : https://github.com/u9wy/WeatherApp

With more time I would have:

1. Added tests for the WeatherForecastPresenter and WeatherService classes.
2. Better documented each class and method.
3. Allow the user to enter their location instead of using a static one.
